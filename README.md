### ClusteringAnalysis
Cluster analysis is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).

In this assignment, I am to run a clustering analysis on any variables that I want to, and develop a report of findings.

I used the clustering process which are (1) calculating dissimilarity matrix, (2) using clustering methods such as wald, euclidean, and (3) assessing clusters. I used both Rstudio and SPSS for the analysis.

Please go to [Analysis (Rstudio)](https://github.com/DriBans/ClusteringAnalysis/blob/main/Analysis4.R) for coding, and Clustering analysis report.
